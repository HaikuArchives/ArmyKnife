<h1><img width="64" height="64" src="./images/armyknife-icon_64.png" alt="ArmyKnife Icon" />ArmyKnife</h1>
<p>ArmyKnife is a powerful tool to perform ID3-Tag to Attribute assignment, Attribute to ID3-Tag assignment, parsing of filenames to fill attributes, and renaming files based on their attributes. It also includes an editor that lets you work with multiple files at once. It supports MP3, Ogg Vorbis and FLAC format.</p>
<p>Note, that to use Haiku's fast queries, the attributes have to be filled. On the other hand, to be useful on other platforms and stand alone players, the ID3 tags should be filled. Therefore, it's best to keep both in sync.</p>
<p>You start either by selecting your files and invoking the context menu <i><b>Open With...</b></i> and choose <i><b>ArmyKnife</b></i> or simply start ArmyKnife and add files via drag&amp;drop. This is ArmyKnife's window, the opened files in a list to the right and controls to the left, depending on the selected mode:</p>
<img src="./images/armyknife.png" alt="ArmyKnife window" />
<p>There are three modes of operation, selected with the drop-down menu on top or switched with <span class="key">ALT</span>&#160;<span class="key">&larr;</span>/<span class="key">&rarr;</span>:</p>

<h2>Edit Mode</h2>
<table summary="Edit Mode"><tr>
	<td valign="top"><img width="234" height="354" src="./images/armyknife-edit.png" alt="Edit Mode" /></td>
	<td width="30"></td>
	<td valign="top"><p>At the top, you decide if you'd like to see and edit the Haiku attributes of the files or their ID3-Tags. The checkbox below decides if your changes will also apply to the respective other.<br />
Below are the different attributes/tags and their contents. If you can't see anything, neither in Attributes-mode nor in Tags-mode, you either haven't selected any files from the list or there really is no information available. In that case you may want to switch to <i><b>Name Mode</b></i> to salvage what's available from the filenames.</p>
<p>All changes only affect the selected files and only after pressing <i><b>Apply</b></i>, which is the default when pressing <span class="key">ENTER</span>. Also, only the checkmarked attributes/tags will be written to these files.</p>
<p>The "Genre" field is a bit of a special case: If you choose to set a custom genre, only Haiku attributes will contain your text. ID3-Tags only show standard genres and will fall back to "Other".</p>
<p>There's some convenient keyboard navigation when you have to edit a tag of single files, e.g. "Title" and "Track" of an album. The cursor can stay in the respective tag's text box while you select a new file with keyboard shortcuts:</p>
	<table summary="Keyboard navigation" cellpadding="0">
	<tr><td width="100"><span class="key">ALT</span>&#160;<span class="key">HOME</span></td><td>First file</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span class="key">ALT</span>&#160;<span class="key">END</span></td><td>Last file</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span class="key">ALT</span>&#160;<span class="key">&uarr;</span></td><td>Previous file</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span class="key">ALT</span>&#160;<span class="key">&darr;</span></td><td>Next file</td></tr>
	</table></td>
</tr></table>

<h2>Copy Mode</h2>
<table summary="Copy Mode"><tr>
	<td valign="top"><img width="234" height="295" src="./images/armyknife-copy.png" alt="Copy Mode" /></td>
	<td width="30"></td>
	<td valign="top"><p>You can copy the checkmarked fields either from <i><b>Attributes&#160;&rarr;&#160;Tags</b></i> or <i><b>Tags&#160;&rarr;&#160;Attributes</b></i>.</p>
<p>Make sure you've got the direction right or you'll accidentally copy empty attributes over perfectly filled ID3-Tags! Better switch quickly over to the Edit mode to have another look...</p>
<p>Again, changes take only effect on selected files after pressing <i><b>Apply</b></i>.</p></td>
</tr></table>

<h2>Name Mode</h2>
<table summary="Name Mode"><tr>
	<td valign="top"><img width="234" height="295" src="./images/armyknife-name.png" alt="Name Mode" /></td>
	<td width="30"></td>
	<td valign="top"><p>You can either rename all selected files according to their attributes (<i><b>Attributes&#160;&rarr;&#160;Name</b></i>) or, conversely, fill attributes according to the filename (<i><b>Name&#160;&rarr;&#160;Attributes</b></i>).<br />
As with the Copy mode, make sure the direction is right!</p>
<p>The filename is analyzed/build with a pattern, selected from the <i><b>Filename</b></i> drop-down menu. Above it is a legend describing what abbreviation corresponds to what attribute. <i><b>\*</b></i> is a wildcard you can use for parts that shouldn't go in any attribute. Of course, you can define your own pattern by choosing <i><b>New..</b></i> from there.</p>
<p>As usual, again changes take only effect on selected files after pressing <i><b>Apply</b></i>.</p></td>
</tr></table>
